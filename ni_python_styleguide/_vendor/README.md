This directory contains any vendored copies of dependencies, and should be used sparingly.

Its purpose is to allow us to release our package in a timely manner without forcing us
to wait for critical changes to be applied to their corresponding repositories.

All vendored dependencies should be listed here along with links to the corresponding
Pull Requests that the vendored copy includes. As soon as the pull requests are merged,
and a package includes the changes, the vendored copy should be removed ASAP and the
official package be consumed.

NOTE: You must include the appropriate license from the package alongside the code!
